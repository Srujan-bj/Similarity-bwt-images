# Image Similarity Detection Using OpenCV and NumPy

A Python-based image comparison system that calculates pixel-level similarity between images using OpenCV and NumPy. The program compares a test image against multiple reference images, computes absolute pixel differences, and identifies the most similar image based on similarity percentage.

## Key Features
- Pixel-by-pixel image similarity calculation  
- Supports multiple reference images  
- Outputs similarity percentage and difference score  
- Identifies the closest matching image automatically  
- Simple, fast, and lightweight implementation  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

## Applications
- Image matching & verification  
- Template comparison  
- Basic visual similarity analysis  
- Educational use in image processing
